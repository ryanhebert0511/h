window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Ninety percent of Americans own a copy of the Bible, and while it's the most widely read book, it's also the least understood. Regardless of your religion, understanding the Bible brings much of Western art, literature, and public discourse into greater focus - from Leonardo da Vinci's \"Last Supper\" painting to the Wachowski brothers' The Matrix movies. People have historically turned to religion to deal with tragedy and change, and with the right insight, the Bible can be an accessible, helpful guide to life's big questions.</p> <p><i>The Bible for Dummies</i> appeals to people of all faiths, as well as those who don't practice any particular religion, by providing interfaith coverage of the entire Bible and the often fascinating background information that makes the Bible come alive. You'll find answers to such questions as:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Where did the Bible come from?</li> <li>Who wrote the Bible?</li> <li>How is the Bible put together?</li> </ul> <p>Follow the history of the Bible from its beginning thousands of years ago as tattered scrolls to its status as the best seller of all time.</p>";
