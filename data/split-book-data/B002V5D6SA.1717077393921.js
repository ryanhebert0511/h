window.bookSummaryJSON = "John Piper writes, \"I will tell you what a tragedy is. I will show you how to waste your life. Consider this story from the February 1998 <i>Reader's Digest</i>: A couple \"took early retirement from their jobs in the Northeast five years ago when he was 59 and she was 51. Now they live in Punta Gorda, Florida, where they cruise on their 30-foot trawler, play softball and collect shells. . . .\" Picture them before Christ at the great day of judgment: \"Look, Lord. See my shells.\" That is a tragedy.\" <p>This book is a passionate call for this generation to make their lives count for eternity. John Piper acknowledges that the risks for those who seek to accomplish something in life - risks in relationships for the sake of righteousness and authenticity, risks with money for the cause of the Gospel, and risks in witnessing to the truth and beauty of Christ. Readers will find their passion for the cross of Christ enlarged as a result of reading this book.</p>";
