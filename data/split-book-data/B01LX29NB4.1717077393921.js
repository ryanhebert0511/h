window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the midst of folding laundry, coordinating carpool schedules, and breaking up fights, many parents get lost. Feeling pressure to do everything \"right\" and raise up \"good\" children, it's easy to lose sight of our ultimate purpose as parents in the quest for practical tips and guaranteed formulas. </p> <p>In this life-giving book, Paul Tripp offers parents much more than a to-do list. Instead, he presents us with a big-picture view of God's plan for us as parents. Outlining 14 foundational principles centered on the gospel, he shows that we need more than the latest parenting strategy or list of techniques. Rather, we need the rescuing grace of God - grace that has the power to shape how we view everything we do as parents. </p> <p>Freed from the burden of trying to manufacture life-change in our children's hearts, we can embrace a grand perspective of parenting overflowing with vision, purpose, and joy. </p>";
