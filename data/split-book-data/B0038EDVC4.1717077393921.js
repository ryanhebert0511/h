window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Sex. Race. Scripture. Sovereignty. The book of Ruth entails them all. So listeners shouldn't be fooled by its age, says Pastor John Piper. Though its events happened over 3,000 years ago, the story holds astounding relevance for Christians in the 21st century. </p> <p>The sovereignty of God, the sexual nature of humanity, and the gospel of God's mercy for the undeserving - these massive realities never change. And since God is still sovereign, and we are male or female, and Jesus is alive and powerful, <i>A Sweet &amp; Bitter Providence</i> bears a message for listeners from all walks of life. But be warned, Piper tells his audience: This ancient love affair between Boaz and Ruth could be dangerous, inspiring all of us to great risks in the cause of love.</p>";
