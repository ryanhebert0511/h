window.bookSummaryJSON = "Believers who wish to thrive in a postmodern world must cling to the joy, truth, and love that comes only from understanding Christ and his ultimate purpose. In a postmodern society where \"absolute truth\" is a foreign concept and religion is without morals, Christians often wonder, \"How can I share the love, joy, and truth of Christ with a hurting world?\" <p>Six of today's leading pastor-theologians - John Piper, Voddie Baucham, D. A. Carson, Tim Keller, Mark Driscoll, and David Wells - have joined together to offer Christians a practical, biblical vision of Christ's supremacy so that they will be better prepared to present the undeniable truth to a searching society. </p> <p>After grounding readers in the important truths of Christ's deity and the gospel, <i>The Supremacy of Christ in a Postmodern World</i> strives to help believers understand how to share these truths in a postmodern society. As readers begin to apply the lessons from this book, they will gain a practical, biblical vision of ministry for the 21st-century world.</p>";
