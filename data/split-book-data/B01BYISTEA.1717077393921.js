window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Discover the single greatest secret to a successful marriage! Touted as a classic among marriage books, </b><b><i>Love &amp; Respect</i></b><b> reveals why spouses react negatively to each other and how they can deal with conflict quickly, easily and biblically. A </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>best seller with over 2.1 million copies sold.</b></p> <p>Cracking the communication code between husband and wife involves understanding one thing: that unconditional respect is as powerful for him as unconditional love is for her. It's the secret to marriage that every couple seeks, and yet few couples ever find. While both men and women deserve both love and respect, in the midst of conflict the driving need for a woman is love and the driving need for a man is respect. When either of these needs isn’t met, things get crazy. </p> <p>Based on over three decades of counseling, as well as scientific and biblical research, Dr. Emerson Eggerichs and his wife, Sarah, have taken the Love and Respect message across America and are changing the way couples talk to, think about, and treat each other. If you want to feel peace, closeness, value, and to experience marriage the way God intended, this book will help you get there. </p> <p><i>Love and Respect</i> is for anyone: those in marital crisis, the happily married, engaged couples, pastors and counselors, and small groups. This dynamic and life-changing message is impacting the world, resulting in the healing and restoration of countless relationships.</p> <p><b>What readers are saying about </b><b><i>Love &amp; Respect</i></b><b>:</b></p> <p></p> <ul> <li>“I’ve been married 35 years and have not heard this taught.”</li> <li>“This is the key that I have been missing.”</li> <li>“You connected all the dots for me.”</li> <li>“As a counselor, I have never been so excited about any material.”</li> <li>“You’re on to something huge here.”</li> </ul> <p>Partner <i>Love &amp; Respect </i>with the <i>Love &amp; Respect Workbook for Couples, Individuals, and Groups </i>for an added experience. <i>Love &amp; Respect</i> is also available in Spanish, <i>Amor y Respeto.</i></p>";
