window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It’s hard to overestimate the importance of the family, and that of fathers in particular. We’ve heard it said, “As the family goes, so goes the nation.” But it can also be said that “as the father goes, so goes the family”. Consequently, Voddie Baucham has set out to teach men how to faithfully shepherd their families.</p> <p>Derived from Baucham’s monthly meetings with men in his church, <i>Family Shepherds</i> calls men to accountability for their God-given responsibilities in their homes. Baucham’s clear style and practical approach will spur men to protect their marriage, raise kingdom-minded children, value the synergy between church and home, and navigate difficult family dynamics.</p> <p><i>Family Shepherds</i> is a book for any husband or father looking to lead well, and it will serve as an excellent resource for churches looking to equip the men in their congregations.</p>";
