window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When people start talking about predestination versus free will, the question is nearly always raised: Does God desire all to be saved? If God elects some and not others, how can biblical passages that say God wants the whole world to be saved be true? </p> <p>Drawing explicitly from the Bible, pastor John Piper argues that God’s choice to elect some and not others is completely compatible with his genuine desire that all people would be saved. With humility and grace, Piper addresses common Arminian pillar texts, showing how they do not contradict God’s absolute sovereignty in salvation. Aiming to encourage passionate worship and energetic mission - not intellectual pride - this short book serves as a helpful introduction to this often debated issue. </p>";
