window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Apologetics is for everyone.</p> <p>The Bible is clear that all believers are called to defend their faith. However, if apologetics is the formal process that we have come to expect, this sounds like an impossible task. But what if apologetics could be part of natural, normal conversation ― both from the pulpit and in everyday life?</p> <p>Aimed at preparing you to clearly and confidently defend your faith, <i>Expository Apologetics</i> sets forth an approach to apologetics that is rooted in Scripture and eminently accessible. Filled with real-world examples and practical advice, this book will equip you with the tools you need to think biblically and converse persuasively offering unbelievers “a reason for the hope that is in you.”</p>";
