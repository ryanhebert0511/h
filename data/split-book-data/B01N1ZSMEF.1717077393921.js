window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Who is Jesus Christ? </p> <p>You've never met him in person, and you don't know anyone who has. But there is a way to know who he is. How? Jesus Christ - the divine person revealed in the Bible - has a unique excellence and a spiritual beauty that speaks directly to our souls and says, \"Yes, this is truth.\" It's like seeing the sun and knowing that it is light or tasting honey and knowing that it is sweet. </p> <p>The depth and complexity of Jesus shatter our simple mental frameworks. He baffled proud scribes with his wisdom but was understood and loved by children. He calmed a raging storm with a word but would not get himself down from the cross. </p> <p>Look at the Jesus of the Bible. Keep your eyes open, and fill them with the portrait of Jesus in God's Word. Jesus said, \"If anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority.\" Ask God for the grace to do his will, and you will see the truth of his son. </p> <p>John Piper has written this book in the hope that all will see Jesus for who he really is and will come to enjoy him above all else. </p>";
