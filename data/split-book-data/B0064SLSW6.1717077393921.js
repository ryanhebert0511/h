window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>More than 60 percent of young people who went to church as teens drop out after high school. This is a striking and alarming statistic. Now the bestselling author of <i>unChristian</i> trains his researcher's eye on these young believers. Where Kinnaman's first book <i>unChristian</i> showed the world what outsiders aged 16–29 think of Christianity, <i>You Lost Me</i> shows why younger Christians, ages 16–29, are leaving the church and rethinking their faith. Based on new research, <i>You Lost Me</i> shows pastors, church leaders, and parents how we have failed to equip young people to live in - but not of - the world and how this has serious long-term consequences. He then offers suggestions on how to help young people develop and maintain a vibrant faith that they embrace rather than toss away.</p>";
