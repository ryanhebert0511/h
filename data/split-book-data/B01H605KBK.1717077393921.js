window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Prayer is crucial in the exercise of faith. It is the lifeline of believers to God. To please God, believers should pray with the right motivation and understanding of what prayer really is. With a good understanding of the deep meanings of prayer, this spiritual exercise can be a powerful tool. </p> <p>Prayer is an act of connecting with God. God loves fellowshipping with his people, but such cannot take place unless someone falls on his knees and begins communicating with him. </p> <p>God knows everyone's needs and provides them to those who believe. Therefore, prayer should not be interpreted as just an act of requesting, or worse, telling him that you deserve receiving something. To fellowship with God is the main purpose of prayer. </p>";
