window.bookSummaryJSON = "N. T. Wright, a world-renowned New Testament scholar and bishop of Durham in the Church of England, has spent years studying the apostle Paul's writings and has offered a \"fresh perspective\" on Paul's theology. Among his conclusions are that \"the discussions of justification in much of the history of the church - certainly since Augustine - got off on the wrong foot, at least in terms of understanding Paul - and they have stayed there ever since.\" <p>Wright's confidence that the church has gotten it wrong for 1,500 years, given his enormous influence, has set off warning bells for Christian leaders such as John Piper, a pastor and New Testament scholar. If Wright's framework for interpreting the New Testament text and his understanding of justification find a home in the church, not only could the doctrine of justification be distorted for generations to come, but the New Testament writers' original intent could be silenced. So Piper is sounding a crucial warning in this audiobook, reminding all Christians to exercise great caution regarding \"fresh\" interpretations of the Bible and to hold fast to the biblical view of justification.</p>";
