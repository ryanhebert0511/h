window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A repository of wisdom and practical counsel for any family going through a divorce.</b> </p> <p>Divorce has devastating effects on children. Yet for divorcing parents who carefully consider and manage the intricacies associated with this difficult time, both parents, as seen from the child’s perspective, can remain as loving and supportive as they ever were. </p> <p><i>Parenting through Divorce</i> concisely lays out the specific emotions and reactions parents need to anticipate from their children while going through separation, divorce, and its after-math. Rather than weighing parents down with complicated plans, confusing information, and legal terminology, this book takes a common-sense approach, providing listeners in a state of emotional distress with the practical, down-to-earth advice they need to sensibly and comfortingly guide their children through this often painful process. Covering the most common mistakes divorcing parents tend to make, as well as addressing special issues that come up for kids of different age groups, this book helps you retain a strong, healthy, and loving environment for your child, even in the midst of change. This is a much-needed repository of wisdom and practical counsel for any family going through a time of heightened feelings and fragile relationships.</p>";
