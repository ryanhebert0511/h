window.bookSummaryJSON = "Reflecting on 40 years of matrimony, John Piper exalts the biblical meaning of marriage over its emotion, exhorting couples to keep their covenant for all the best reasons. Even in the days when people commonly stayed married \"'til death do us part\", there was never been a generation whose view of marriage was high enough, says Pastor John Piper. That is all the more true in our casual times. <p>Though personal selfishness and cultural bondage obstruct the wonder of God's purpose, it is found in God's Word, where his design can awaken a glorious vision capable of freeing every person from small, Christ-ignoring, romance-intoxicated views. Piper explains in reflecting on forty years of matrimony: \"Most foundationally, marriage is the doing of God. And ultimately, marriage is the display of God. It displays the covenant-keeping love between Christ and his people to the world in a way that no other event or institution does. Marriage, therefore, is not mainly about being in love. It's mainly about telling the truth with our lives. And staying married is not about staying in love. It is about keeping covenant and putting the glory of Christ's covenant-keeping love on display.\" </p> <p><i>This Momentary Marriage</i> unpacks the biblical vision, its unexpected contours, and its weighty implications for married, single, divorced, and remarried alike.</p>";
