window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The best of A. W. Tozer, on one of his favorite subjects. </p> <p>Few subjects invigorated A. W. Tozer like the topic of worship. He saw it - like the church has traditionally - as the sole reason for which creation exists. <i>Worship: The Reason We Were Created</i> features collections from the beloved spiritual writer on this important topic. The church's current worship is emaciated; its thoughts of God are too low. Here is a compilation to raise those thoughts high once more, and provoke the church to true, spiritual worship. Topics include: </p> <p></p> <ul> <li>The act and object of worship </li> <li>The presence of God </li> <li>Worship throughout the week </li> <li>Feelings and emotion in worship </li> <li>Man as a worshipping creature </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>If it's true that we are made to worship God, that it is the sole reason that we exist, that we are most alive when we live for His glory, then listening to <i>Worship</i> is more than time well spent. It is time invested in the very foundation of your life. </p>";
