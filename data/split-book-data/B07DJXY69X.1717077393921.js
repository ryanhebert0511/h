window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>More teens are turning away from the faith than ever before: It is estimated that 75 to 88 percent of Christian teens walk away from Christianity by the end of their freshman year of college. Something must be done.</p> <p><i>Family Driven Faith</i> equips Christian parents with the tools they need to raise children biblically in a post-Christian, antifamily society. Voddie Baucham, who with his wife has overcome a multigenerational legacy of broken and dysfunctional homes, shows that God has not left us alone in raising godly children.</p> <p>This bold book is an urgent call to parents - and the church - to return to biblical discipleship in and through the home.</p>";
