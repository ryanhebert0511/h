window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>One of the greatest crimes of this generation of Christians is its neglect of the Gospel, and it is from this neglect that all our other maladies spring forth. Absent from too many pulpits are the essential themes that make up the very core of the Gospel: the justice of God, the radical depravity of man, the blood atonement. </p> <p>In <i>The Gospel's Power and Message</i>, Paul Washer addresses these essential elements of Christ's good news and provides a guide to help us rediscover the Gospel in all its beauty, scandal, and saving power. May such a rediscovery transform your life, strengthen your proclamation, and bring the greatest glory to God. </p>";
