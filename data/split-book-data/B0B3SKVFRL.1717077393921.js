window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>If the church is going to use the Bible to decide whether divorce is legitimate in certain cases and whether divorced couples have the right to remarry with the approval and blessing of Godâ€™s people, then the Bible must be studied without prejudice toward a particular answer. The author examines the relevant passages in both the Old and New Testaments so that his listeners can consider the many issues and interpretations that arise in trying to establish a consistently biblical position. As a result, listeners can see more clearly and accept more firmly the truth of Scripture.</p> <p>The book succeeds at being exactly what the author wanted it to be: \"a comprehensive, lucid, accurate study presented in a readable and practical style. . . .\" It is a valuable resource for the pastor, counselor, church leader, and others who are struggling to understand and apply scriptural principles to the problems of divorce and remarriage.</p>";
