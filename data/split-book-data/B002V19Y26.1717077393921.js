window.bookSummaryJSON = "John Piper delivers powerful biblical reassurances to bolster readers' trust in the sovereignty of God and the supremacy of Christ when evil and tragedy come. <p> If God governs the sinful acts of men, then does the devastation caused by those terrorists, dictators, murderers, cheats, and abusers discredit Jesus' words: \"All authority in heaven and earth belongs to me\"? When heart-rending news comes of the latest accident, illness, or natural disaster, can we really believe that in Jesus, \"all things hold together\"? </p> <p>Though God has not answered all of our questions about sin and suffering, there are things he wants us to know, things he declares in his Word - such as what's at stake in the \"spectacular\" sins of others and the horrible tragedies of this life; their global purpose, both historically and today; and what these events say to us personally. As John Piper works through these biblical truths, this book will bolster readers' trust in the utter sovereignty of God such that they'll be less timid in their witness and less afraid of whatever may come. It is also a joy-infused declaration that because everything occurs through Christ and for Christ and his glory, they are forever secure in him.</p>";
