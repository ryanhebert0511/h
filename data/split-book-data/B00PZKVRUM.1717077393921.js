window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Healing Scriptures From Genesis To Revelation: 300 Healing Bible Verses On The Proven Healing Promises From God's Word</b></p> <p><b><i>Your healing words and healing promises from God's Word. These healing scriptures of God's medicine are paraphrased for an easy read.</i></b></p> <p><b>Here Is A Preview Of What You Will Learn</b></p> <p>Some of the most powerful scriptures are the healings and miracles Jesus performed that were recorded in the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. This is an often untapped power for healing in the twenty first century. The scripture tells us in Hebrews 13:8: “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever”. If He was willing to heal someone of sickness and disease yesterday, then He is surely willing to heal anyone of us today! Here is a scripture of a man asking if Jesus was willing to heal him. We can also ask Him. Look at the recorded scripture below:</p> <p>Matthew 8:1-3: “When Jesus came down from the mountainside, large crowds followed him. 2: A man with leprosy came and knelt before him and said, “Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.” 3: Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. “I am willing,” he said. “Be clean!” Immediately he was cleansed of his leprosy.”</p> <p>Included in this book, is a comprehensive list of 300 healing bible verses, which were compiled with healing scriptures from Genesis to Revelation. My goal was to find every healing scripture that was provided in the bible. I have paraphrased each healing scripture for an easy read. These healing scriptures will help you to renew your mind to God's way of healing!</p> <p>I pray that as you meditate on these healing scriptures that you may prosper and be in health, even as your soul prospers! (3 John 1:2).</p> <p><b>Grab This Book For A Life-Changing Experience!</b></p>";
