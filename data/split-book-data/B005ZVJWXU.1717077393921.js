window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Based on his most popular sermon series, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Timothy Keller delivers an extraordinarily insightful look at the keys to happiness in marriage. </p> <p>Few subjects are as compelling-or as endlessly variable-as love and marriage. The Bible is filled with references to husbands and wives, from the story of Adam and Eve to advice in the New Testament, each open to interpretation. </p> <p>In <i>The Meaning of Marriage</i>, Timothy Keller, pastor of New York's Redeemer Presbyterian Church and bestselling author of <i>The Reason for God</i>, uses the scriptures as his guide to show readers what God's call to marriage is, and why this is such a powerful call. He talks in frank terms about the difficulties that couples have and how they can best work them out while keeping their faith in God intact. </p> <p><i>The Meaning of Marriage</i> showcases Keller's vast understanding of the Bible and how it can not only be relevant to relationships today but also form the foundation of a modern, healthy, loving, and long- lasting marriage.</p>";
