window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>God has provided a way for all people, not just scholars, to know that the Bible is the word of God. John Piper has devoted his life to showing us that the glory of God is the object of the soul's happiness. Now, his burden in this book is to demonstrate that this same glory is the ground of the mind's certainty. </p> <p>God's peculiar glory shines through his word. The spirit of God enlightens the eyes of our hearts. And in one self-authenticating sight, our minds are sure, and our hearts are satisfied. Justified certainty and solid joy meet in the peculiar glory of God. </p>";
