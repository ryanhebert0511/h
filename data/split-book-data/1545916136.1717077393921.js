window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Have you ever closed your Bible and thought, What did I just read? Or maybe you have tried to read through the Bible in a year, but quit when it felt confusing or impersonal. <i>The Bible Recap</i> is here to help. Tara-Leigh Cobble, host of the popular podcast <i>The Bible Recap</i>, walks listeners through a one-year chronological Bible reading plan and explains each day's passage in an easy-to-understand way.</p> <p>Emphasizing how God's character can be seen throughout Scripture, the recaps are simple and short yet deep enough to help you understand the hard parts and press into knowing God better. As Cobble says, The primary role of Scripture is to show me who God is, and if I behold God, my life will naturally conform around what I learn about him. <i>The Bible Recap</i> will not only help you grasp the entire narrative of the Bible, it will fortify your faith.</p>";
