window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>A Small Book about a Big Problem</i> by biblical counselor and psychologist Edward T. Welch guides listeners to look carefully at how their anger affects them and others through short, daily meditations.</p> <p>In a 50-day reading plan journey, Welch unpacks anger while encouraging and teaching listeners to respond with patience to life's difficulties.</p> <p>This biblically wise resource is a useful tool for pastors, counselors, and lay helpers who are working with people who struggle with a short fuse.</p> <p>In <i>A Small Book about a Big Problem</i>, Welch invites listeners to consider how everyone can find anger in their actions and attitudes, but Jesus, the Prince of Peace, is the only one who can empower his people to grow in patience, peace, and wholeness.</p> <p>How many times today have you been irritated? Frustrated? Anger is so common - yet it also hurts. It not only leaves a mark on us, but it also leaves a mark on others.</p> <p>The wounds we inflict on ourselves and others because of anger-loss of intimacy, trust, security, and enjoyment in our closest relationships - give us compelling reasons to look closely at our anger and lift our eyes to Christ.</p>";
