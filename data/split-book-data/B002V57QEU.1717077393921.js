window.bookSummaryJSON = "Why is the church so ineffectual and characterized by the mosaic generation as unchristian? The term \"born again\" has been devalued both in society and in the church. Recent social studies surveys have shown that those who regard themselves as born-again Christians have the same tendency to divorce as people who aren't Christians at all! In these surveys, being born again is defined by what people say they believe. <p>The New Testament defines Christians very differently. Piper defines new birth biblically and helps us to embrace the reality of it: \"I hope that showing that the new birth is not in our control helps make pastors and other Christians desperate for the supernatural in their ministries.\"</p>";
