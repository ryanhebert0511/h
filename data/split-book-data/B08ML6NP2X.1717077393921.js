window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The Pursuit of God</i> by A.W. Tozer is an inspirational book that aims to guide those who wish to follow Christ. It draws on biblical teachings that emphasize the concept of seeking the divine. Man must consider God as not only as creator, but the one who sustains life; hence, all creatures must depend solely on him. </p> <p><i>Wingspread</i> is the biography of A.B. Simpson, written by A.W. Tozer. A pastor and missionary, Simpson's work became what is now the Christian and Missionary Alliance, a denomination characterized by its Christ-centered teaching and emphasis on missions. Simpson's influence saw a convergence of Calvinistic doctrine with the holiness movements of the late 19th century. Simpson and the C&amp;MA had an enormous influence upon the evangelical foreign missions movement of the 20th century. Simpson is an interesting and key figure, in no small part due to his teachings on the four-fold Gospel and on healing.</p>";
