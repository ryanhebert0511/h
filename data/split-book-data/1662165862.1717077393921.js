window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A timeless classic by Arthur W. Pink, originally published in his monthly </b><b><i>Studies in the Scriptures</i></b><b>. </b></p> <p>The truths in <i>The Attributes of God </i>are essential for a proper knowledge of God. In the author’s own words, “a spiritual and saving knowledge of God is the greatest need of every human creature.... An unknown God can neither be trusted, served, nor worshipped.”</p> <p>If Christians are to be strong, they must know well the God in whom they believe and trust. God must be more than just a theory. Discover again, or for the first time, who God truly is. Rejoice in his many attributes, such as his solitariness, his supremacy, his immutability, his holiness, goodness, patience, love, and grace.</p>";
