window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In dark times, God can seem silent. We feel isolated, confused, and alone. Everyone experiences suffering - even the biblical writers express similar feelings in the Psalms. Through brief meditations on Psalms 88 and 89, Ligon Duncan points to hope in the midst of the pain of feeling abandoned by God. These examples of crying out to God show listeners how to respond to their own suffering, and assure them of our heavenly Father's mercy that sustains trust even in the darkest of circumstances. </p> <p>With clarity, empathy, and compassion, Duncan points us to the powerful hope found in these psalms that ultimately point us to Christ's promise to never leave us alone.</p>";
