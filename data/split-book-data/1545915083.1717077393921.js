window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>As you prepare for marriage, dare to dream with God.</p> <p>Getting to know that special someone naturally involves learning about family and friends, education and athletics, favorite pastimes, and your hopes and dreams. Ideally, you'll talk about life's best moments and worst, the brightest places in your background and the darkest.</p> <p>But what about God? What is his role in your relationship? What do each of you believe about him, and how do you understand his dream for marriage-for your marriage?</p> <p>John Piper wants to help you faithfully walk the road to becoming husband and wife. Here you'll find his counsel on practical topics like engagement, wedding planning, finances, and sex. But most importantly, John shares his single most vital word on marriage: a vision grander than many of us have ever dared to dream, about what God is doing in every Christian marriage.</p>";
