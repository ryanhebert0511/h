window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>What does it mean to be \"crucified with Christ\"? During his lifetime, renowned teacher A. W. Tozer was often invited to speak at seminaries, churches and Bible conferences on the topic of the cross and its meaning for the Christian life. Now, in this never-before-published distillation of his best teaching on the subject, you will gain a fresh understanding of the cross’s centrality to your walk of faith in Christ. The apostle Paul declared in his letter to the Galatians that he had been “crucified with Christ.” But what does this mean? Is this a claim every believer can and should make? </p> <p><i>The Crucified Life</i> is a comprehensive examination of these questions, answered with the deep, biblical thinking for which Tozer was revered. “God is ingenious in developing crosses for His followers,” Tozer was fond of saying. At the heart of this audiobook, you will find a call to follow Christ to the cross and be raised to new life - a call to live the crucified life. Includes authentic audio clips of A.W. Tozer speaking after each chapter.</p>";
