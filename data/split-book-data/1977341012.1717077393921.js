window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Unwanted: How Sexual Brokenness Reveals Our Way to Healing</i> is a groundbreaking resource that explores the \"why\" behind self-destructive sexual choices. The audiobook is based on research from more than 3,800 men and women seeking freedom from unwanted sexual behavior, be that the use of pornography, an affair, or buying sex. </p> <p>Jay Stringer's original research found that unwanted sexual behavior can be both shaped by and predicted based on the parts of our story - past and present - that remain unaddressed. When we pay attention to our unwanted sexual desires and identify the unique reasons that trigger them, the path of healing is revealed. </p> <p>Although many of us feel ashamed and unwanted after years of sexual brokenness, the audiobook invites the listener to see that behavior as the very location God can most powerfully work in their lives. Counselors, pastors, and accountability partners of those who experience sexual shame will also find in this audiobook the deep spiritual and psychological guidance they need to effectively minister to the sexually broken around them. </p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
