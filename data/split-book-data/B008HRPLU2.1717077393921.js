window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Boasting more than one million copies of his works sold, conservative radio personality Dr. James C. Dobson squarely addresses the problem of troubled marriages. He targets infidelity, alcoholism, spousal abuse, and emotional distance as the primary causes of divorce. Dobson also chooses to denounce homosexuality as an abomination. With his groundbreaking theory of \"loving toughness\", he offers a path toward solving marital problems, building family values, and rekindling lost romance.</p>";
