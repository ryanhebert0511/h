window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When you say “I do\", you begin the journey of a lifetime, and you have dreams of that journey being perfect. But it won’t take long for expectations of the perfect marriage to fade away in the struggles of everyday life. A long-term, vibrant marriage needs to be grounded in something sturdier than romance - it needs the life-changing power of the gospel.</p> <p>In this rebranded edition of <i>What Did You Expect?</i>, popular author and pastor Paul David Tripp encourages couples to make six biblical commitments to the Lord and to one another. These commitments, which include a lifestyle of confession and forgiveness, building trust, and appreciating differences, will equip couples to cultivate thriving, joy-filled marriages built on Christ.</p>";
