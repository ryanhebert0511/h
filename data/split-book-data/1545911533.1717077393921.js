window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Turn your world on its head. </p> <p>For more than 30 years, John Piper pastored in the rough-and-tumble realities of downtown Minneapolis, preaching his people through the ups and down of life one Sunday at a time. When it came to capturing a generation of joy in one final sermon series, he turned to 10 trademark truths to leave ringing in his peoples’ ears. </p> <p>These 10 are world-shaking truths - each astonishing in its own way. First, they turned Piper’s own world upside down, then his church’s, and they will continue to turn the whole world upside down as the gospel of Christ advances in distance and depth. These surprising doctrines, as Piper writes, are “wildly untamable, explosively uncontainable, and electrically future-creating”. </p> <p>Join a veteran author, pastor, and Christian leader as he captures the 10 astonishing, compassionate, life-giving, joy-awakening, hope-sustaining truths that have held everything together for him. This audiobook is a revised edition of the earlier title <i>Doctrine Matters</i>.</p>";
