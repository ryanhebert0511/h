window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>I believe. These two words are among the most explosive words any human can utter. </b></p> <p><i>The Apostles' Creed</i> has shaped and guided Christian faith for almost 2,000 years. Shared by Protestant, Roman Catholic, and Eastern Orthodox traditions, it is perhaps the most compelling and formidable statement of Christian doctrine the world has ever known. But do we know what it really means - and how it applies to us today?</p> <p>In <i>The Apostles' Creed</i>, renowned theologian and Pastor R. Albert Mohler Jr. works line-by-line and phrase-by-phrase through each section of the Creed, revealing the rich truths it contains, including: </p> <ul> <li>The profound mystery of the Trinity</li> <li>The miracle of the Incarnation</li> <li>The world-shaking truth of the resurrection</li> <li>The hope of Christ's return</li> <li>The theological heritage contained in this ancient statement</li> </ul> <p><i>The Apostlesâ€™ Creed</i> is an often-overlooked treasure that contains the power to shape us for vibrant and steadfast living today, equipping believers to live faithfully in a post-Christian culture. </p>";
