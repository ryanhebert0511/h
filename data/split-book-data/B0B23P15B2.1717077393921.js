window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In <i>Please Don’t Say You’re Sorry</i> marriage-loving divorce attorney Nicole Sodoma shows up with empowering advice to help you sustain a real and happy marriage, recognize when that’s just not possible, and know what to expect and do from there. What’s more, she does it with a generous dose of humor to remind you that you can and will laugh again.</p> <p>When Nicole Sodoma ended her 13-year marriage, she found herself seated in a symphony of sympathies and quickly began to question why people say “congratulations” when we marry and “I’m sorry” when we divorce. There’s no denying that divorce sucks. You've invested years in a relationship. Then in what feels like the blink of an eye, everything has changed, and you are faced with more resolution options than New Year's Eve. The journey can be wholly overwhelming, but it doesn’t have to be the worst thing that’s ever happened to you.

In <i>Please Don't Say You're Sorry</i> she serves up both the humorous and the decidedly unfunny realities of marriage and divorce alongside empowering insights for finding your way through either. From hard truths about the unintended consequences of ending a marriage to relatable tales from divorces past, Nicole's communication style will help you feel deeply understood as you try to render those seemingly impossible decisions.</p> <p>Whether you are looking for advice on how to better your marriage, are considering separation, or find yourself knee-deep in divorce, this audiobook has something for you.
