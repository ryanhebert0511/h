window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Apostle Paul gave the Gospel the first place in his preaching, endeavored with all his might to proclaim it clearly, and even went so far as to pronounce a curse upon all those who would pervert its truth. Yet how sad it is that many, even among those considering themselves evangelicals, have reduced the Gospel's message to a few trite statements to be repeated and view conversion as a mere human decision. </p> <p>In <i>The Gospel Call and True Conversion</i>, Paul Washer challenges such easy believism as he examines the real meanings of things like faith, repentance, and receiving Christ. He also deals extensively with the effects of saving grace that God promises in the new covenant - namely, the creation of new hearts and new people. </p>";
