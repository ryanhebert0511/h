window.bookSummaryJSON = "According to Warren Wiersbe, <i>The Supremacy of God in Preaching</i> ''calls us back to a biblical standard for preaching, a standard exemplified by many of the pulpit giants of the past, especially Jonathan Edwards and Charles Spurgeon.'' <p>This newly revised edition is an essential guide for preachers who want to stir the embers of revival. Piper focuses his study on the example of Jonathan Edwards as an illustration of a leader who submitted to God.</p>";
